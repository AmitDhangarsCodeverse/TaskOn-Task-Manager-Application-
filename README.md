# ✨ Task Manager – Stay Organized, The Smart Way!

Welcome to the **Task Manager App** – a lightweight, intuitive, and responsive task management tool built with plain **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript**. No frameworks, no fluff – just clean code and practical features to help you focus on what matters: getting things done.

Whether you're tracking daily chores, managing a to-do list, or organizing your project tasks, this app gives you a simple but powerful way to stay on top of your goals.

## 💡 Why I Built This

We all need a way to manage our day – sticky notes get lost, and spreadsheets are overkill. I wanted to create a small, fast, and customizable app that feels like a productivity buddy instead of a complicated tool.

Plus, I used it as an excuse to sharpen my TypeScript skills and write clean, scalable front-end code — something every developer should practice.

## 🧰 Tech Stack at a Glance

- **HTML5** – for the structure and layout
- **CSS3** – for styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript** – for all the interactivity
- **TypeScript** – for type safety and better developer experience

No frameworks, libraries, or build tools needed — just open your browser and go.

## 🚀 Features

Here’s what the Task Manager can do for you:

- 📌 **Add New Tasks** – Just type and hit add
- ✅ **Mark Tasks as Complete or Incomplete**
- 🗑️ **Delete Tasks** – Out of sight, out of mind
- ✏️ **Edit Tasks** – Fix that typo or reword your goal
- 🔍 **Filter Tasks** – View all, completed, or pending tasks
- 💾 **LocalStorage Integration** – Your tasks stay put even after a refresh
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly** – Use it on the go from any device

Simple to use. Easy to extend. Built for real-world usage.
